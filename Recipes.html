        Roasting vegis is one of the best things I have started to do this year. It is not only delicious, but really healthy. The secret ingredients? Oil and Adobo powder. We put these two things on vegis before roasting them in the oven and it makes a world of difference. I personally do not like steamed vegitables so this is a great way of getting your vitamins into your diet. 
        Smoothies. Literally all you need is frozen fruit, orange juice (without pulp) and a blender. I would suggest getting frozen fruit that doesn't have seeds because it can be messy and it ruins the smoothness of the smoothie. 
        
        <br><p>Organic choices and GMOs</p>
        <p>There has been a lot of debate over whether or not GMOs are bad for us or not. Most people are not aware that the majority of foods they eat contain Genetically Modified Organisms. These are foods that have had their DNA altered to be more ripe, bigger, and better. For example, a chicken that grows big quickly provides more meat for everyone. Scientists have not done signicant research on the effects of GMOs on humans. Although there is no scientific proof, some people claim GMOs can cause cancer. The real issue is that Americans are not told what foods contain GMOs, so it is hard to make an informed decision when orddering or buying food. In Europe, all GMO products are labeled as such. On the bright side, foods that are USDA approved organic, locally grown, or hormone-free are labeled in America. Going back to nature has positive results for ssome, especially in regards to Eastern or holistic medicine and food choices. Some people who are trying to recover from cancer switch to only organic foods and do not use any household products containing certain chemicals, and their cancers have gone into remission.

        <p>So why am I telling you about eating organically or healthy? Well, if you visit your local Whole Foods, Trader Joes, or Organic Market, you can find certain foods at comparible prices to those found in regular groceries stores.</p>
