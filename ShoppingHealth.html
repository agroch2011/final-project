        <h2>Exercise Tips</h2>
       <p>Craigslist workout groups are a great way to get in shape for free. My boyfriend and I joined a one day a week exercise group in the city and it was a great way for us to exercise for free with others. </p>
     <br>   <p>Check to see if your university or college offers dance or group fitness classes. At my school its 5$ per session, but it is still very cheap. Gyms are free on most campuses, but if you are looking for something new that isn't as monotonous as the treadmill, then I highly suggest group classes.<p>

        <h2>Groupon Steals</h2>
      <p>  If you do not have eye or dental insurance and you are away from home, do not fret! Groupon has many deals for super cheap that will allow you to keep up on your health. I just got a teeth cleaning, X-rays, and exam done for only 30$! I have gotten laser hair removal done and I am getting an eye exam and prescription sunglasses for only $50. These are deals that you just can't pass up! Sometimes these deals are even cheaper than what you would pay even with insurance. </p>
            <br>
       <p>Groupon is also great for simple upkeeping. For example, there are mani-pedi packages for cheap, massages (for after a stressful day of studying) and hair cuts/dyes. </p>

       <h2>Clothing Suggestions</h2>
       Do you need mittens or scarves but do not want to pay 15$ on them? Go to the Dollar Store or 5 Below! These stores have so many clothing options, like yoga pants, scarves, gloves, socks, and even hats! You can even get household products that are great like: mugs, trashbags, soap, napkins, candles, presents, snacks, and even shampoo and conditioner. <br> <br>
<p> If you are looking for more designer-ish clothes, I would suggest visiting Plato's Closet. Or if you have clothes you want to get money for, you can also bring them to Plato's Closet and you will get a good profit off them. <p>
       <p> Outlet stores are awesome! All the stores you love are there and the clothes are at such a high discount. </p>

            <h2> Food </h2>
              Roasting vegis is one of the best things I have started to do this year. It is not only delicious, but really healthy. The secret ingredients? Oil and Adobo powder. We put these two things on vegis before roasting them in the oven and it makes a world of difference. I personally do not like steamed vegitables so this is a great way of getting your vitamins into your diet. 
            <br> <br> 
       <p> Smoothies. Literally all you need is frozen fruit, orange juice (without pulp) and a blender. I would suggest getting frozen fruit that doesn't have seeds because it can be messy and it ruins the smoothness of the smoothie.</p>

                 <h2> Eating Outide the Home</h2>
    Only go where there are discounts. For example, eat at places that use a student discount with a valid I.D. Or go to places that offer special deals. For example, California Pizza Kitchen gives you free 5$ of pizza dough for every 100$ you spend. <br> 
        <br> <p>Or if you can get rewards at places like Panera Bread, you can get complimentary bakery-cafe items. Also, look for deals on special holidays, like the free "boo-rito" Chipotle offers every Halloween.</p> </div>
