<div class="boxthree">Here are a few tips I have for you to save money in college.
        
        Rule of Thumb: If you spend money on one item, be prepared to sacrifice that for something else. For example, I know if I go out to dinner with friends Friday night, I should lay low Saturday to make up for the money spent from Friday.</div>
        
       <div class="middle"> My boyfriend makes an Excel sheet with all his expenses listed on it. In this way, he was able to calculate how much he spends each week. 
        There are numerous apps on smartphones that can help you keep track and budget your money as well. The links are listed below:</div>
        
       <div class="end">  The Simple Card
        <p>I had heard many good things about the Simple card, which is a credit card that is completely runned through an online bank. It makes transfering money from seperate accounts easy and it even lets you send checks via online or through your phone. I tried signing up and I have been put on a waiting list (because there are so many applicants), but it is well worth the wait. </p> </div>
